/**
 * Aggregated view stored by WorkflowInstance. It serves two purposes. First, when an instance run
 * starts/restarts, it keeps the aggregated info of all previous runs, i.e. the aggregated info from
 * run 1 to the previous run. It will be null if this is the first run. This aggregated info is
 * called baseline aggregated info and will be kept in DB in the workflow instance table. Second,
 * when any caller (users or other applications) asks for its aggregated info, baseline will then be
 * merged with the current run's real-time step status and workflow status to get the current actual
 * aggregated info. Note that only baseline is kept in DB and the real-time aggregated info will
 * always be computed at calling time. The real time workflowInstanceStatus is kept in workflow
 * instance status. The stored workflowInstanceStatus in DB is the aggregated status of previous run
 * and used for computing the current aggregated status. Maestro engine should not directly return
 * baseline workflowInstanceStatus to the callers. Instead, it should use workflow instance status
 * or run_status.
