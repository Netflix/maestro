/**
 * This is the interface for flow operations. It includes start a flow or wake up flows in the
 * distributed flow engine cluster. If the flow engine is running in multiple nodes, the operation
 * implementation must be able to reach other nodes. Flow engine provides the necessary data model
 * support (e.g. address field in FlowGroup class) to be used by the operation implementation. The
 * FlowOperation interface can be implemented based on multiple technologies, such as socket, RPC,
 * REST, Zookeeper, distributed job queue, database, etc.
 *
 * <p>For socket, RPC, or REST implementation, it can send the synchronous API request to the target
 * node and get the response from the remote node. This requires to know the target node address,
 * which is the part of flow group data model.
 *
 * <p>The distributed job queue requires to dispatch the request to the worker with the ownership of
 * the flow group. Most queueing systems does not support it. Instead, we can broadcast the request
 * to all the nodes and then the worker with the group ownership will take the operation and other
 * nodes discard it.
 *
 * <p>For database implementation, it can simply save requests to a database table and then the
 * worker (i.e. GroupActor) can query the database table periodically to get the requests and then
 * delete them after processing.
